# Project Brief: Cosmic Cults

Cosmic Cults is a Lovecraftian real-time strategy (RTS) game built with the Bevy game engine. The goal is to create a playable RTS that targets WebGL/WASM for browser-based gameplay, featuring cult management, combat, and exploration mechanics.

## Core Objectives
- Modern Bevy (0.17+) implementation.
- Leverage ecosystem crates (avian3d, big-brain, leafwing-input-manager, etc.) instead of custom "from-scratch" logic.
- Target WebGL/WASM for easy accessibility.
- Support three distinct cults with unique leaders and units.
- Implement fog of war and procedural terrain generation.
